A used car pricing engine !
NextCar is a used car pricing tool to help car buyers and sellers talk about price realistic manner. A study from 2021 Cox Automotive Car Buying Journey (https://www.coxautoinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-Car-Buyer-Journey-Study-Overview.pdf ), mentions that shoppers are looking for a fair car price not only for new vehicles, but also for used vehicles and the vehicles they currently own. This used car pricing engine is designed to induce frictionless transaction experience between buyers and sellers.
Given the attributes of a used car, NextCar regression model application will need to predict the price or market valuation of a used car for sellers and buyers alike with reasonable accuracy. This application is targeted at anyone interested in buying or selling a used car, for example used car dealers or consumers looking to purchase a new car.   
We will take a dataset that contains information on 426K cars from Craigs-List provided by Kaggle as a starting point to develop a regression model. This is done to ensure speed of processing. Our goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. As a result of the analysis, we should be able to predict the price of  a used car given its attributes.  The goal is to provide a dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.
